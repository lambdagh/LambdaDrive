## Goal of this Project
It is, to learn how to make an entire Projects involving different Components, like making a Frontend, implementing Auth, Payments, Database, etc... Really just to learn to develop an entire App and not just certain parts. So I don't care who uses it, its just for educational purposes and anyone can just take a look as they please, but I do not allow any pull requests, since this isn't an Open Source Project, it's just for myself.
